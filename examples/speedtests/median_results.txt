Time(ms) to fill buffer and get median 100 times on an ESP32.
The time for 100 runs at the given sample size was summed for each library and then the sum of VectorStats was subtracted.
This was done rather than averaging because the times for DataTome were not consistent, with some taking much longer.
VectorStats was up to 1.5x faster with a large buffer size of 4095.
With an even buffer size of 4096, VectorStats was up to 2.5x faster.
RunningMedian is limited to a max buffer size of 255, but it was still slower than VectorStats at large buffer sizes.
At larger sample sizes, VectorStats is significantly faster.
It also outperforms when using even-sized buffers.
As the sample size gets down to around 255 the differences become negligible.
